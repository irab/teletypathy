# 3. Parse corpus files

# Example: Analyze spoken component
# 1. Access COCA online
# 2. Search for spoken language
# 3. Extract word frequencies
# 4. Compare with written frequencies
```

### Using Buckeye Corpus (Licensed)

```python
# Buckeye Corpus includes phonetic transcriptions
# Example workflow:
# 1. Load Buckeye corpus files
# 2. Extract phonetic transcriptions
# 3. Count phoneme frequencies
# 4. Analyze phoneme sequences
# 5. Optimize encoding patterns

def analyze_buckeye_phonemes(corpus_path):
    """Analyze phoneme frequencies from Buckeye Corpus."""
    phoneme_counts = Counter()
    
    for file in corpus_files:
        # Load phonetic transcriptions
        phonemes = load_phonetic_transcription(file)
        
        # Count phonemes
        for phoneme in phonemes:
            phoneme_counts[phoneme] += 1
    
    return phoneme_counts
```

## Recommendations

## Conclusion

Several research corpora are available for analyzing spoken English conversations. For Teletypathy development:

1. **COCA** (free) - Best for quick word frequency analysis
2. **Buckeye Corpus** (licensed) - Best for phoneme analysis
3. **Switchboard** (licensed) - Best for large-scale conversation analysis

These corpora can provide valuable insights into:
- Phoneme frequencies in natural speech
- Word frequencies in speech vs. writing
- Phoneme-per-word distributions (for multi-ring optimization)
- Natural conversation patterns

Access to licensed corpora typically requires LDC membership (common for academic/research institutions).
