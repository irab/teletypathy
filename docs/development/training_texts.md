# Training Texts for Learning Teletypathy

## Overview

This document recommends English texts that are effective for learning tactile communication patterns in Teletypathy. Good training texts should facilitate pattern recognition, build muscle memory, and progressively increase difficulty.

## Principles for Effective Training Texts

### 1. High Frequency Patterns
- **Repetition**: Common letters/phonemes appear frequently
- **Muscle Memory**: Repeated patterns become automatic
- **Quick Wins**: Early recognition builds confidence

### 2. Progressive Difficulty
- **Start Simple**: Common words, simple patterns
- **Build Complexity**: Gradually introduce less common patterns
- **Scaffolded Learning**: Each level builds on previous

### 3. Meaningful Content
- **Context**: Meaningful words aid memory
- **Engagement**: Interesting content maintains motivation
- **Practical**: Real-world vocabulary

### 4. Pattern Diversity
- **Balanced**: Mix of common and rare patterns
- **Variety**: Different word lengths and structures
- **Coverage**: Exercises all patterns eventually

## Recommended Training Texts by Level

    # Use words containing target patterns
    # Ensure high repetition
    # Progressive difficulty
    pass
```
