# Teletypathy

A tactile communication system that translates keystrokes and text messages into physical actuator signals delivered through wearable hardware.

## Project Overview

Teletypathy enables real-time tactile communication by converting keyboard input and text messages into vibration patterns that can be felt on the skin. The system targets ultra-low latency (<10ms) for real-time communication using vibration motors (ERM/LRA) as actuators.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Research & Approach Design
- Linguistics and language interface research
- Human-computer interface research
- Sense augmentation research
- Encoding system design

### Phase 2: Hardware Platform Selection
- Hardware requirements analysis
- Platform evaluation and benchmarking
- Hardware architecture design
- Prototype validation

### Phase 3: Software Development
- Core library development
- Desktop application
- Embedded firmware
- Integration and testing
